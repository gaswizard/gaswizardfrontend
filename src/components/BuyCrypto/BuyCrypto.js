                  1. Firstly, make sure you have one of the supported wallets
                  ready. For desktop, we recommend using the Metamask browser
                  extension. For mobile, we recommend using TrustWallet and its
                  built in browser.

                  2. Click on the "Buy $GWIZ" button to enable Gas Wizard to
                  connect with your wallet. Once connected, you can buy $GWIZ
                  tokens using a selection of currencies from the ETH chain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  {" "}
                  3. Choose the amount of $GWIZ tokens you wish to buy or the
                  amount of your assets you wish to spend and click "Buy now".
                  We recommend having at least $10 of ETH to cover gas fees. If
                  you don't have enough ETH please transfer it from any crypto
                  exchange to your wallet address or buy more through Metamask
                  or TrustWallet marketplace.
